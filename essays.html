	<p>The following essays are my opinons at the time of writing. I am too aware of the permanancy of data when it is uploaded to the internet. This is a disclaimer - my opinions may change in the future. One hopes that as time moves forward, people gain more knowledge and opinions are strengthended or weakened. However it is difficult to predict which way opinions will be swayed. So, cancel culture dont @me</p>
